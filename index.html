            In this iteration of my personal website, I was so inspired by Chris Krycho's wonderful <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/about/">Sympolymathesy</a> that I determined to set up something very similar on my own, basically copying Chris's structural and stylistic decisions. I got as far as setting up a <a href="https://v1-notes-manankhattar-com.vercel.app/">microblogging website</a> similar to <a href="https://v1.notes.chriskrycho.com/">Chris's old microblog</a>, but quickly lost steam. Clearly, copying someone else's blog structure built up over years of iteration and customization and expecting it to <i>just work</i> (and also attempting to build up my nascent blogging habit at the same time) wasn't a great idea. In any case, check out <a href="https://manankhattar.com">manankhattar.com</a> for the newest version of my website!
